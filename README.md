Car Image Generator App
This project is also a web then that is made by Streamlit and allows the users to create images with the help of the pre-trained generator model. The client is able to upload the generator model and input images, and then the output which is the generated images will be shown.

USAGE
With this project, we have developed a web application for the user to upload pictures and use a prepared generator model. Users can:
Upload the generator model provided in the repository(in . h5 format).
Select an image that they would wish to use with the generator
The code creates a similar image to the one uploaded but of lesser quality due to the structure of the generator model we used. 
The application is hosted on a local server on your pc using a command prompt via your web browser a
‘http://localhost:8501.’
